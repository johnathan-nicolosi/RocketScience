[Rocket Science](http://spacescienceblog.com/articles/science-and-technology/rocket-science.html)
This repository includes various Python programs related to the math and physics of rocket science. The focus on the scripts in this repository is on rocket science using Python as opposed to Python itself. I have used Python3 to build these various applications. You will also need a few external Python libraries, such as PyOrbital, BeautifulSoup4, Numpy and Matplotlib, in order to run these scripts.
